Today I learned how to create a file and modify a file directly from the terminal.
For that I had to navigate using " cd .." from my original terminal all the way to the new one, then I used "touch Chapter2.md" to create the new file, and from there I tryed using Nano Chapter2.md to open this text editor and write this. After this I will press Control X to close, and try to push it. Hopefully it works.

Chapter 2 - Learning to Push to GitHub

We have learned the commands to push our files to github in three commands

1. git add.
2. git commit -m "CommentAboutCommit"
3. git push origin "BranchName"


To update the last changes in my local environment you need to follow this steps:
1. Go to main branch
2. git pull --all
>>>>>>> origin
