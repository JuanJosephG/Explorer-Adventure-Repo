Today I learned how to create a file and modify a file directly from the terminal.
For that I had to navigate using " cd .." from my original terminal all the way to the new one, then I used "touch Chapter2.md" to create the new file, and from there I tryed using Nano Chapter2.md to open this text editor and write this. After this I will press Control X to close, and try to push it. Hopefully it works.
