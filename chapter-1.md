There once was a bear. This bear wanted to go to sleep because it was cold. All of his friends were scared because he did not wake up. After 8 months the bear woke up. When all his friends asked what he was doing, he said I was "hiBearNating".
All of his friends were happy to see that he was safe. 
After the bear said hi to all his friends, they went to the lake to go fishing. It was getting cold after eating a lot of fish, so the bear went to sleep.
